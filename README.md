UHub is meant to be a localized forum which would be used by university students and groups as a way to share communities, ideas, advice, and various other topics. This will provide students with a place to find new, common, or even unprecedented ideas from other students while sharing communities that they feel they belong to. It will be designed to bring all of the segregated small communities around campus into one universal platform for interactions with the university community. This will allow students to easily get involved with clubs by eliminating the hassle of having to attend the first meeting to understand the structure of the club.  Student communities on-campus are typically small and poorly advertised, and UHub will provide students the tools they need to move these communities forward into a larger scale. UHub will give students the ability to manage multiple groups in a shared space, discover new communities around campus and interact with one another outside of the ebb and flow of university life.
